"""The COVID-19 origins court: five years of docket, on the real calendar.

WHY THIS SCENARIO EXISTS. Every other scenario here is a mechanism test wearing
placeholder text — "The county certified 12,412 mail ballots". This one is the
demo: a court whose docket a stranger can read and recognise, with claims that
really are disputed, positions taken in the weeks the evidence actually landed,
and claims that die unanswered because nobody could answer them yet.

THE CALENDAR IS REAL. The clock is armed at 1 February 2020 and walked forward,
so a position carries the timestamp of the week it was taken and the claim under
it is the one people were arguing about that week.

    2020-02  the Proximal Origin authors draft; the first positions are taken
    2020-03  "The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2" is published in Nature Medicine
    2021-05  a Senate exchange on NIH funding of gain-of-function work
    2021-07  a second Senate exchange
    2022-01  drafting correspondence is released under subpoena
    2023-02  the Department of Energy assessment is reported
    2023-03  the FBI's assessment is confirmed publicly
    2023-07  a criminal referral goes to the Department of Justice
    2024-05  HHS suspends EcoHealth Alliance's federal funding
    2024-06  public testimony before a House subcommittee
    2025-01  a revised CIA assessment is reported

THE DOCKET'S SHAPE IS FORCED BY A REAL RULE, and it is the most realistic thing
here. `deadClaimSecs` is twelve weeks: a claim nobody answers within that window
CLOSES rather than resolving. So a court cannot hold a five-year-old open
question — and a real market on an unresolved question does not try to. It asks
again each time new evidence lands, and the old contract expires unanswered.

That is exactly the history of this question, so the docket tells it that way. The
laboratory-origin claim is opened in 2020, dies unanswered, is opened again after
the 2023 agency assessments, dies again, and is open once more after the 2025
assessment. Eleven claims, of which:

  * three are matters of record and RESOLVE — the funding trail, the drafting
    correspondence, the reporting failure;
  * five DIE UNANSWERED, because they were asked before anybody could answer
    them, which is a real outcome this system has a verb for;
  * three are OPEN at the end, because the world has not resolved them.

WHAT THE CLAIMS SAY. A court adjudicates propositions, so each is written as
something that could be found true or false on evidence. Nothing here asserts a
finding the world has not made. The laboratory-origin claims stay open because the
intelligence community is itself split — some elements assess a laboratory origin
as more likely, others natural spillover, at low to moderate confidence either
way. The testimony claim is an allegation referred to prosecutors on which no
charge has been brought, so it is on the docket as a question about what a
tribunal WOULD find, unresolved. An unadjudicated allegation is precisely the
thing this product exists to price, and pricing one is not asserting it.
