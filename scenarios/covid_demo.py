"""A populated COVID-19 court: five years, sixteen participants, a filed docket.

WHAT THIS IS FOR, and how it differs from covid.py beside it. That one is a
narrative: eleven claims chosen to demonstrate one rule — a claim nobody answers
within twelve weeks CLOSES rather than resolving — and it is a CI scenario with a
generated txtar. This one is the fixture you point a browser at: THIRTEEN
claims in SIX folders, sixteen accounts, and fourteen relations between claims,
so every surface the overlay has is looking at something.

Those numbers used to read "thirty-eight claims in twenty-four folders", and the
sentence after them promised they were "the counts the file actually produces".
They were not — the docket was trimmed to thirteen for the hourly-window reason
KEEP explains below, and the tree was cut from twenty-four folders to six because
thirty boxes on a map is a filing cabinet, not a docket. A count that describes
itself as measured has to be measured.

TWO ARTIFACTS, AND THE CHAIN CAN ONLY HOLD ONE OF THEM. This was the first thing
worth finding out and it shapes the whole file:

  * the realm's `folder` struct had an id, a name, a description and a list of
    claim ids, and NO PARENT — on-chain folders were flat, and a subfolder did
    not exist on this chain.
  * relations between claims were not on the chain at all. The overlay said so on
    every screen that drew one: "the chain stores no relations".

**BOTH OF THOSE ARE NOW FALSE, and this file used to be built around them.**
`folder.parent` shipped with `CreateFolderIn`/`MoveFolder`/`OrderFolders`
(maxFolderDepth 4, maxFolders 100), and §5's argument edge shipped as this
realm's ASSOCIATION (`AddAssociation`, and the bond that prices a stranger's).
So the tree and the argument graph go ON CHAIN here, out of the same table that
used to write them to a browser file.

What is still curation, and it is now one thing rather than two: claim-to-claim
CONTAINMENT (`part`). §5 allows a containment parent to be a *section* only, §6
defers sections, and folders are the containment this realm chose — so a
claim→claim `part` edge is the one shape §5 forbids, and it stays in the file the
reader keeps. The curation file is still written in full, because demo mode has
no chain to read and needs a tree of its own.

Both come out of ONE table below. The scenario knows each claim's id because ids
are `c.nextID`, per court, sequential from 1 — so the curation it writes cannot
reference a claim that does not exist, which is the failure the overlay warns
about ("N claim ids are not on this chain"). covid.py tracks its ids as
hand-written constants (`FUNDING = 2`); insert one claim above and every later
constant is silently wrong. This one counts them.

THE CALENDAR IS REAL. THE HEIGHT CANNOT BE, AND THAT IS THE REALM'S DECISION.
The first version of this file walked clock and height together at the chain's
five seconds a block, so the dates the overlay derives from `now:<unix>:<height>`
would match the dates the timeline reports. The realm refused it, correctly:

    kourtv2: the test height moves forward, by at most two emission periods a step

`maxHeightTotal` is ten emission periods — about ten weeks of blocks, ever. It is
capped that low on purpose and the reasoning is in testclock.gno: `touch()` walks
emission periods ONE AT A TIME, so the gas of the next transaction into a court
grows with the periods elapsed. Measured there: ~520k gas steady state, 713
MILLION after one legal step at an earlier 1e9 cap. Past the per-transaction gas
ceiling the touch reverts, `lastAccrual` is never written, and every entrypoint
that touches first is dead in that court FOR EVER — sealing included. One legal
call, irreversible. Five years of height is 33 million blocks. It is not a limit
to work around; it is a guard against bricking the court.

So the clock walks five years (maxAdvanceTotal is a hundred) and the height
advances only where a gate actually needs it — 2,160 blocks for answerability.
The consequence is worth stating because it is visible in the product: a claim's
TIMELINE dates are the real 2020-2025 stamps, while the CHART's x-axis is block
heights and the overlay dates those by extrapolating from `now:(t,h)` at five
seconds a block. On this fixture those two disagree, and they must — no fixture
can have a five-year clock and consistent heights on a realm that caps height
skew at ten weeks. Disputes are therefore left OPEN rather than voted through:
closing one costs votingBlocks + graceBlocks = 138,240 blocks, and six of them
would spend most of the ten-week budget to reach a state a reader can already see
from the docket.

WHAT THE CLAIMS SAY. A court adjudicates propositions, so each is written as
something a tribunal could find true or false on evidence, and nothing here
asserts a finding the world has not made. Where the record is genuinely split —
the origin question, the laboratory hypothesis — the claim stays OPEN, which is
the honest state for it. Where a matter of record has been established — what was
funded, what a document says, what an agency published — the claim resolves. An
unadjudicated allegation on the docket is not an accusation; pricing a question
is the thing this product does.

# or five stakes, all in the filing week and all one way, and the charts were
# flat. ClaimSeries is CHANGE-ONLY and bucketed per 720-block epoch, and `goto`
# moves exactly one epoch a step, so a claim's chart has as many points as it has
# DATES with movement. Five dates, five points, no shape.
#
# So a claim carries a position HISTORY: eight to eighteen moves over its life,
# both sides, with unstakes. Unstakes are not decoration — they free committed
# coin, which is what keeps sixteen accounts inside their budgets while trading
# this much, and a book where nobody ever leaves is not a book.
#
# Each shape returns (day-offset, actor-slot, side, delta) with delta<0 meaning
# unstake. Slots are filled per claim from its own cast, so the same shape reads
# differently in different hands.

# circulate — compiled from 345 posts in ~/gopath/src/github.com/jaekwon/covid,
# with counts, citations and my own assessment in CLAIMS.md beside them — and
# their `arc` is what the record says happens to each one:
#
#   yes      the evidence carried it
#   no       it was answered against — the false ones live here, and watching
#            them settle NO is the demonstration
#   dispute  answered, then challenged; a sealed vote is still running
#   answered answered and nothing else yet — the settle clock is still running
#            at the story's now. Every other arc reaches a resting state, so a
#            docket built only from them shows a court where nothing is in

#
# THE WHOLE TREE, ON CHAIN: three roots, and one of them carries the only
# subfolders. Built from the same `path` tuples the curation file uses, so the two
# can never disagree about the shape of the docket — the failure the old split
# invited.
#
# THREE, AND NOT THE TWENTY-FOUR IT HAD. The first version put every claim at the
# bottom of a three-level chain of its own — Origins → Natural spillover → The
# market cluster → one claim — which on a map is thirty boxes and six straight
# threads out of the middle, and reads as a filing cabinet rather than a docket.
# Depth costs a reader something and buys nothing when the leaf holds one claim.
# So the branching lives where the docket actually has a sub-structure worth
# naming, and everywhere else a claim sits in its root.
#
# Parents strictly before children, and not by sorting: ensure_folder recurses up
# the path and creates what is missing, so a parentID is always a folder the
# chain has already acknowledged. `mustNestable` would refuse otherwise, and it
# counts depth against maxFolderDepth = 4 — this tree is two, with room to spare.
#
# The ids are TRACKED rather than read back. CreateFolder/CreateFolderIn return
# the id, but a scenario step is a broadcast and not a value, so the plan cannot
# capture it. folderSeq increments by one per create and starts at 0, so counting
# creates in this process gives the same numbers the realm assigns. Any drift
# would show up immediately as an AddToFolder into the wrong folder — which is
# why the placements are asserted at the end.
#
# THE FAUCI FOLDER IS A ROOT NOW, not a cross-cut hung off a fifth branch. It was
# one: four claims filed elsewhere by evidence type, with a folder crossing those
# branches to read them together. That works — AddToFolder checks membership
# within one folder only, so a claim may sit in several, and the map draws the
# extra membership as an "also filed here" spoke. But it made the folder's own
# contents invisible next to its subject, and the subject is what a reader came
# for. As a root with the evidence types BELOW it, the same four claims are one
# click from the thing they are about. The cross-cut path stays exercised by
# map_test.js and folders_test.js, which is where that behaviour belongs.
#
# NAMED FOR THE RECORD AND NOT FOR THE PERSON. Every claim under it is about a
# document or a proceeding with a stated settlement condition; the folder is a
# reading order, and it asserts nothing its claims do not.

# EVERY SET IS BORN OF A CLAIM. Not one CreateFolder in the docket's filing
# system: each heading is filed as an ordinary claim whose title opens with the
# wedjat, staked and answered and settled like any other, and only then carried
# into a set by New. That is the whole point of the mark — the court
# decides its own filing system rather than being handed one.
#
# BATCHED IN PHASES, and the arithmetic is why. A set-claim needs its open
# interest matured (three stakes across two epochs, 1,440 blocks) and then the
# 51,840-block settle delay. Done one set at a time that is ~53,280 blocks each
# and seven of them would be 373,000 — three emission periods spent on filing.
# Done in phases, every set shares the same two waits: 53,280 blocks TOTAL,
# under half a period, against a 1,209,600 budget already 598,320 spent.
#
# THE CLAIM IDS COME FIRST, deliberately. These have to exist and be affirmed
# before any docket claim can be filed into them, so they take 1..N and the
# docket starts after — see `ids`, whose enumeration begins at len(SET_PATHS)+1
# for exactly this reason. Any hardcoded #/c/covid/<n> from before this change
# names a different claim now.
#
# THE DESCRIPTION BECOMES THE CLAIM'S BODY rather than the folder's desc field.
# New creates the set with an empty description on purpose: the claim
# behind it has a body, a stake history and a verdict, which is a better account
# of what belongs in the set than a line anybody could have written, and it means
# the text lives in exactly one place.

# THE BUG THIS REPLACES BRICKED THE CHAIN. One actor staked 40 CC on each of six

# holds — so Stake panicked with "not enough unstaked CC". Because these
# transactions run INSIDE GENESIS, that is not a failed seed: the node cannot
# replay its own genesis and will not start at all. It crashlooped 18 times and
# took kourt.xyz down until the previous scenario was restored.
#
# SIZED AGAINST effMinAnswerX, which is what actually gates an answer:
# max(0.10% of the court's supply, 1 CC dust arm). Measured on the seeded chain
# — supply 5,102.8 CC, so the floor is 5.10 CC. The old 40 CC was 8x that per
# round and nobody had picked the number for a reason. 8 CC clears it with a
# ~1.6x margin, which survives the supply drifting as the seed's buys land.
#
# AND SPREAD, so no single balance carries the whole filing system: three actors
# rotate, giving each ~2 headings x 3 rounds x 8 CC = 48 CC rather than 720.
# Rotating also makes the headings look filed by the court rather than by one

    # observations of the SAME claim. Staking a claim ten times in a day leaves
    # filled at 1, which is why every row on this fixture read "no trend yet" —
    # the whole five-year narrative fits inside one window, by design, since a
    # calendar step moves 720 blocks.

    # SO THE WINDOW IS CROSSED BETWEEN A CLAIM'S FIRST AND SECOND MOVE. Crossing
    # it once at a fixed date matured exactly one claim: these claims live about
    # twenty-six days each and are spread over five years, so on any date only
    # one is mid-life. Doing it per claim is what makes the number of trends
    # something this file decides rather than something the calendar decides.

    # move loses only its opening point and builds the rest afterwards.

# §5's ARGUMENT EDGE, which this realm calls an ASSOCIATION. Filed last, after
# every claim exists, because AddAssociation refuses an edge whose either end is
# missing — and filing them as the claims appeared would need the graph sorted
# into calendar order for no gain.
#
# WHO SIGNS EACH ONE IS THE POINT, and it is the whole bond design in eleven
# transactions:
#
#   * the asserting claim's OWN AUTHOR pays nothing. That is most of this graph,
#     because "my claim #7 bears on your claim #3" is normally said by the person
#     who filed #7.
#   * a MODERATOR pays nothing either. One edge here is filed by the court's own
#     moderator, which is what curation looks like.
#   * a STRANGER posts a refundable bond. Three do: one returned by a moderator
#     who agreed, one BURNED by a moderator who did not, and one nobody judged.
#
# THE THIRD ONE'S WINDOW IS ALREADY CLOSED, AND NO BACK-DATED FIXTURE CAN DO
# BETTER. A bond's window is fourteen days of BLOCK TIME from the write
# (clock.gno: a deadline a user plans around gates on time, not height). These
# associations are written at the fabricated present — 2025-06-01 — and then
# SealTestClock hands the chain back to its real clock, which is well past
# 2025-06-15. So the moment the seal lands, the unjudged bond is reclaimable and
# `ClaimAssociationBond` succeeds rather than refusing.
#
# That is worth stating because the first version of this comment claimed the
# third bond was "still HELD because nobody has looked yet", and a probe against
# the seeded node disproved it in one transaction. A PENDING bond needs a write
# at real time: scenarios/assoc_demo.py never arms the clock, so its bonds have
# live windows, and the demo note there says so.

# only claims in this docket that are ANSWERED — so both parties exist — and
# still open. That is not a limitation of the fixture, it is the rule: a board
# stops taking comments the moment the claim has a verdict.
#
# ROW IDS ARE COUNTED HERE, NOT READ BACK. `cs.boardNextID++` is per claim and
# sequential from 1 (board.gno), so the same discipline this file already uses
# for claim ids applies: count them, never hand-write them. `row()` is the
# counter, and a reply or an upvote that named a hand-written constant would go
# silently wrong the moment a comment is inserted above it.
#
# EVERY COMMENTER BUYS A PASS FIRST. Most of these actors have STAKED, not
# earned standing, and postLevel reads standing — so without a pass PostComment
# refuses at level 0 and this whole section would emit transactions that all
# revert, producing an empty board and a green run.
# FOUR WITHDRAWALS, AND THEY ARE HERE TO BUY STANDING RATHER THAN COIN.
#
# UpvoteComment is weighted by standing and refuses an address with none
# (board.gno). Nobody in this fixture had any, and the reason is not the ladder
# or the tier — it is that conviction standing is credited inside WithdrawBonus
# (openrewards.gno), so a staker earns it by coming back to COLLECT, and this
# docket never collected. Measured on a seeded node before it was believed:
# every one of the sixteen actors read `score:0` from StandingBreakdown, and the
# credit rates were non-zero, so it was not a rounding story.

# ------------------------------------------------------------ what it built
#
# Asserted, not described. A folder id tracked in this process rather than read
# back from the chain is a guess until something checks it, and these reads are
# the check: the tree's shape, one leaf's contents, the cross-cut folder, and the
# graph around the claim the most edges point at.
# THE WHOLE TREE IN ONE READ. FolderTree answers `id:parent:flags` per row in
# creation order, and creation order is deterministic — so this asserts the exact
# shape rather than that something exists: three roots (parent 0), and folders
# 3, 4 and 5 all hanging off folder 2, which is the Fauci one.
# UNANCHORED, and it has to be: an expect greps the whole `gnokey query` output
# line, which begins `data: ("`, so a pattern anchored with ^ can never match.
# The full comma sequence pins the shape without needing them.
# DERIVED, NOT WRITTEN OUT. This was the literal "1:0:-,2:0:-,3:2:-,4:2:-,5:2:-,
# 6:0:-", which encoded the order CreateFolder/CreateFolderIn happened to file
# them in. Making the sets born changed that order — SET_PATHS sorts roots first
# so every parent exists before its children — and the literal then described a
# tree nobody builds: it wanted 3 nested and 6 at the root, the run produced 3 at
# the root and 6 nested. Both are the same SHAPE, three roots and three children
# under Fauci; only the numbering moved.
# So the expectation is now built from FOLDER_ID and the paths themselves, which
# is the same source the seed files them from. A literal here would have to be
# re-derived by hand every time the tree changes, and the failure mode is this
# one: a check that looks precise and is actually pinning an accident.
# THE FOURTH FIELD IS bornOf, which moved into the row so a client stops paying
# one SetBornOf per folder on every draw. Derived here from SET_CID for the same
# reason the rest of this line is derived: a literal would encode whichever
# claim happened to birth which set on the day it was written. A set a moderator
# simply made carries 0, which is what .get's default says.
# THE FLAGS FIELD IS DERIVED TOO, and it was the last literal left in this line.
# It said "-" for every row — no folder has a picture — while the seed itself
# calls SetFolderImage on the Fauci folder a few hundred lines up, so FolderTree
# answered "i" there and this expectation could never match. Caught on a
# throwaway node; on the live host it would have been a twenty-minute reseed
# ending in a failed expect.
# That is exactly the failure the comment above warns about, one field over: a
# check that looks precise while pinning something nobody builds. So the set of
# picture-bearing folders is named here, beside the derivation that reads it, and
# a second SetFolderImage in this scenario has to be added to it.
