"""The association bond, on a real chain: who pays to connect two claims.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. `AddAssociation` lets anybody say "claim 4 bears on claim 1", and
COURTS_STRUCTURE.md §5 says anybody still may. What changed is the price, and the
price is the whole story this file tells, in the order it happens:

  * a claim's own AUTHOR connects their own claim — pays nothing;
  * a MODERATOR connects two claims it did not write — pays nothing;
  * a STRANGER connects two claims — posts a refundable bond;
  * a moderator APPROVES one — the bond goes back and the edge stays;
  * a moderator DISAPPROVES another — the bond BURNS and the edge is dropped;
  * a griefer fills one claim with junk and a moderator clears it in ONE tx;
  * the mass APPROVE gives every bond back and leaves every edge standing.

WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHAT IS ONLY NARRATED. Every edge appearing and vanishing
is asserted against `ClaimAssociations`, which is the read the claim page draws from.
The MONEY is narrated but not asserted, and the reason is a limitation of this
DSL rather than a choice: `Balance` takes an address, and `_args_sh` runs every
argument through `shlex.quote`, so a `$ACTOR_ADDR` would reach the chain as the
literal nine characters. Reading the balances back is a `gnokey query` away once
the node is up, and the plan prints the command.

ONE MODERATOR, SO m = 1, and that is worth saying plainly rather than leaving a
reader to wonder why the bulk burn fires on the first signature. `AppointMods`
takes addresses too, so this scenario cannot build the two-moderator set that
would show `DisapproveAllAssociations` waiting for a second key. That threshold is
pinned by TestTheBulkBurnTakesTwoSignaturesAndSparesWhatArrivedMidVote instead,
which also covers the part no demo can show: a bond posted BETWEEN the two
signatures is spared, because it has been judged by nobody.

WHY THE BOND IS REPRICED HERE. The realm default is 1 CC, and CC is bought with
GNOT along the court's curve, so the interesting figure would be buried in
curve arithmetic. The court's own moderators set it to 5 CC — which is itself one
of the two places the figure lives, so the demo exercises the override on the way
to needing it.

    scripts/seed-node.sh scenarios/assoc_demo.py

THIS ONE NEVER ARMS THE CLOCK, and that is what makes it the fixture where a
PENDING bond can be seen. A bond's window is fourteen days of block time from the
write, so a back-dated docket cannot hold one open: scenarios/covid_demo.py writes
its associations at a fabricated 2025 and then seals, which hands the chain back
to a real clock already past every window. Here the writes happen now, so an
unjudged bond is genuinely pending and `ClaimAssociationBond` refuses with "the
moderation window on that bond has not closed yet".

Not a CI scenario: it is a fixture to point a browser at.
