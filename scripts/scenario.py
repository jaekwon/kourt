"""Scenario runner: a chain story, written once, run two ways.

A scenario is a Python module that builds a list of steps against the API in
this file. It compiles to a txtar script (run by `make txtar-test`, a real
in-memory node) and — later — to a plan of gnokey calls against a live node the
website can read. One source, two targets, so the demo and the end-to-end test
cannot drift apart.

WHY PYTHON DATA AND NOT A BESPOKE GRAMMAR. Two design passes argued this out.
The domain needs quoted free text (folder names and descriptions), trees (the
demo's folders nest), and repetition (three failed dispute rounds; two thousand
blocks) — so a line grammar would have grown quoting, then key=value, and would
have rebuilt Python's own call syntax with worse errors and a parser of its own
to test. A module gets comments, real line numbers in tracebacks, and constants
like YES/NO that cannot coerce (YAML would read a bare `no` as false, and this
domain's tokens are literally yes and no).

WHAT THIS FILE REFUSES TO DO.

  * It does not predict height. tm2 proposes an extra "proof block" whenever the
    app hash changed, so the same script can finish at different heights run to
    run (measured: 6/7/7/6/8), so no step names an absolute height and no
    assertion compares one. Wall-clock IS predicted, because the test clock is
    frozen while armed and only `advance` moves it. (An earlier draft of this
    paragraph claimed height was "ASSERTED against the chain"; no such verb was
    ever built, and a docstring promising a guard that does not exist is worse
    than one that admits the gap.)
  * It does not let an assertion call a write. Several entrypoints read like
    getters and are transactions (AuthorBonus, PullCarrot, ClaimMetaFranchise
    ...); an `expect` naming one would broadcast while pretending to query. The
    guard is an ALLOWLIST read out of the realm source at emit time, not a
    hand-kept denylist — a denylist is only as good as the last time someone
    remembered to extend it, and this one had already missed
    ClaimMetaFranchise(cur realm).
  * It does not let a refusal pass on a simulation. `gnokey maketx` defaults to
    -simulate test and returns BEFORE broadcasting when the simulation errors —
    so a plain `! gnokey ...` proves only that the simulator refused. Refusals
    emit -simulate skip and are asserted on-chain.

        The twin of advance(). Conviction accrues per block, emission rolls per
        period, votes close on a block and the twap ring matures on one — so
        before the height override existed, every one of those could only be
        reached by mining: ~2,160 blocks to answer, 17,280 to open the rewards,
        120,960 to resolve a dispute. Those are minutes to hours of real time
        for something the chain will happily be told.

        Prefer this to mine(). `mine` is still right when a scenario is
        asserting something about REAL block production; it is wrong when the
        scenario is merely waiting.

        `with_time` also advances the clock by blocks x BLOCK_SECS, exactly as
        mine(with_time=True) does — one spelling for "this much chain time
        passed", rather than a height call and a hand-computed second call that
        have to be kept in step by whoever edits either.

        IT IS WHAT THREE SCENARIOS NEEDED AND NONE COULD SAY. p/governor moved
        its vote deadline from a height to a STAMP (closesTime, read by
        votingClosed), so a scenario closing a week-long vote has to move both
        clocks; scn_covid, scn_dispute and scn_rewards_demo each moved only the
        height and left the vote open at ANY height until 8ce2717 repaired them
        by hand, one 700_000 at a time.

        OPT-IN, for mine()'s reason and not a weaker one: "a scenario testing a
        deadline boundary needs the clock to move only when it says so". smoke.py
        advances to one second short of the dead-claim timeout and asserts the
        chain still refuses — silent per-block time would break exactly that.

        AND NOT FOR A CALENDAR SCENARIO. covid.py walks real dates through
        goto(), which computes its delta from the narrative date it tracks and
        cannot see a bare advance; using this there would put the chain days
        ahead of every date the file prints. It uses goto() for its dispute
        close, and should keep doing so.

        seeded chain's dates and heights stay in a plausible relationship.
        Without it the frozen clock does not move while blocks are mined, and a
        node seeded through 2,200 blocks reports the claim as OPENED AND
        ANSWERED AT THE SAME INSTANT — observed on the deep node, where the
        resolution ladder read "opened ... 82 days ago / answered ... 82 days
        ago" with 2,200 blocks between them.

        It is OPT-IN, not the default, because a scenario testing a deadline
        boundary needs the clock to move only when it says so: smoke.py advances
        to one second short of the dead-claim timeout and asserts the chain still
        refuses, which silent per-block time would break.

        APPROXIMATE, and it cannot be otherwise. The advance is keyed to the
        blocks the scenario REQUESTS, not to the blocks the chain ends up
        producing — tm2 inserts a proof block whenever the app hash changed, so
        the real height is unpredictable (ruling O1). Measured on the deep node:
        2,200 requested blocks became 4,408 real ones, so the seeded chain
        implies ~2.5s a block rather than 5. That is a plausible chain, which is
        the goal; it is not an exact one, and nothing downstream should treat

    WHY THIS EXISTS. emit_plan broadcasts one `gnokey maketx` per step and waits
    for each to commit. Measured on covid_demo: 636 transactions at 0.365s each,
    which is 3m52s of a 4m06s run — the seed IS that loop. Almost all of the
    0.365s is local: keyring decrypt and signature, not the node, which answers a
    query in 33ms. Broadcasting from several accounts at once does not help; a
    batch of eight fired together landed NONE while eight sequential landed all
    eight.

    Genesis transactions skip every one of those costs. gnodev applies a txs-file
    at startup, and sets SkipGenesisSigVerification (contribs/gnodev/pkg/dev/
    node.go), so the `caller` field is taken at face value and the signature is
    never checked — which is why gno.land's own genesis_txs.jsonl ships
    `"signature":""`. So this emitter signs nothing and spawns no processes: it
    writes a file.

    WHAT IT GIVES UP, stated plainly because it is the reason emit_plan stays.
    The plan checks every transaction as it lands and prints the realm's own
    panic when one fails; that check caught four separate mistakes in one
    afternoon. Genesis application is bulk, so a failed transaction here does not
    stop the run. The `expect` assertions are the compensating control and they
    still run afterwards, against the node, at query speed — so a scenario whose
    seed silently half-applied is caught by what it then reads back, not by what
    it wrote.

    REFUSES A SCENARIO IT CANNOT REPRESENT rather than emitting a file that
    quietly differs: `mine` steps advance real block height, and every genesis
    transaction lands in the same block. A scenario that mines has to keep the
    broadcast path. (covid_demo does not mine — it walks the realm's test clock,
    which is state and therefore a transaction like any other.)

      * refusal steps are DROPPED — a seed run is not a test, and a deliberate
        failure would only leave a confusing error in an operator's log;
      * assertions become greps, since testscript's stdout matching is gone;
      * mining is explicit sends, because a live node with -empty-blocks=false
        advances height only on real transactions.

    Consumes $KEYDIR/$REMOTE/$CHAINID/$PASS from the launcher; makes no node.
