"""Give a runner its own GNOROOT, so staging cannot collide with anything.

Every gno-based runner here stages the realms into
$GNOROOT/examples/gno.land/{p,r}/kourt and removes that tree afterwards. The path
follows the import paths baked into the sources — they are what make `gno test`
resolve a sibling package there at all, so it moved when they did in the
2026-08-16 rename. STAGED below still accepts the pre-rename org name as well,
and the reason is in the comment above it: a tree left behind under the old name
must stay removable. So the tree was shared by five
runners across every worktree on the machine — realm-test, check-isolation,
mutate, check-storage and the txtar TestMain — each of them ending with an rm -rf
of a directory the others might be reading. That produced a "c.mod undefined"
build failure in code that was fine, an outright `make isolation-test` failure,
and mutation rows scored INVALID because the mutant could not build what it no
longer had.

The lock that came before this made it CORRECT by making it serial. This makes it
PARALLEL, which is what was actually wanted: two worktrees can now run their
suites at the same time, and neither can see the other.

# How

GNOROOT is honoured from the environment, so the runner gets a shadow of it:
every top-level entry SYMLINKED, except `examples`, which is a real copy. Only
the examples tree needs to be real — gno's package discovery walks it and does
not follow symlinks, which is the whole reason a symlink farm alone does not work
— and it is a few tens of MB, on the order of a second, once per run. Everything
expensive (gnovm, tm2, the stdlibs) stays a symlink and is never copied.

What this does NOT do is rewrite import paths, which was the other way to get
per-worktree staging and a bad trade: the code under test would then differ
textually from the code that is committed, and a test suite that proves things
about slightly different source is worth much less.

    MODULE CACHE, whose every file and directory is mode 0444/0555 by design.
    copytree preserves that, so the first mkdir failed with

        mkdir: .../examples/gno.land/r/kourt: Permission denied

    and then, because the staging loop kept going, a `cp` reported that the same
    path "is not a directory" -- two errors, neither naming the cause, for a tree
    that had copied perfectly.

    Only the COPY is touched. The module cache itself is never modified: it is

    the permissions and contents this would otherwise corrupt.
