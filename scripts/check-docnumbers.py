"""Hold doc.gno's numbers to the ones the code actually uses.

The terms every early decision clears are written twice: once as Go in
governor.gno's init, and once as a table in doc.gno for the person deciding
whether to launch on them. That is a duplicated RULE, which VERIFYING.md says
to collapse — and this one cannot be collapsed, because a realm cannot read its
own source and a doc comment cannot call a function. So it is pinned instead.

It matters more than most of the duplications in this realm. The table is what
somebody reads before launching, the numbers decide whether their first
adoption can pass at all, and a stale table is invisible: the realm keeps
working, the tests keep passing, and the only symptom is a launch that fails on
a quorum nobody was told about.

The code side is arithmetic rather than literals — `7 * 24 * 60 * 60 / 5` for a
week of blocks — which is deliberate, and is exactly why the doc repeats the
product. Both sides are evaluated here rather than compared as text.

Needs no toolchain; it reads the two files.
