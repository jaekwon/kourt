"""An `elsewhere` annotation must name a harness that ACTUALLY OBJECTS.

A corpus row carrying `elsewhere` says: this mutation survives the mutation
harness BY DESIGN, because the property is held somewhere the harness does not
look. That claim has three levels, and each one was hollow until it was checked:

  1. Does the path RESOLVE? check-mutation-anchors has always asked that — "an
     excuse pointing at nothing is worse than no excuse".
  2. Does anything in `make check` RUN it? Until txtar-test was added to check,
     SIX of the seven rows named txtar scripts that the routine never ran.
  3. Does the harness ASSERT the property? This script. A txtar that runs and
     says nothing about the mutation leaves the excuse exactly as hollow as an
     unrun one, and nothing else can notice: the row goes on surviving in
     `make gaps`, which is precisely what it is supposed to do.

WHY THIS IS CHEAP, and why the reason first given for not building it was wrong.
The claim was that the two harness kinds need different plumbing — a txtar runs
against a staged GNOROOT while a python guard reads the repo. They do not. The
txtar harness stages realms into GNOROOT/examples FROM THE REPO, and the guards
read the repo directly, so BOTH kinds see a mutation applied to realm/ in place.
One code path serves both: mutate the repo, run the named harness, require it to
fail, restore. Measured at ~2.4s per txtar script, so the whole sweep is seconds.

MUTATING THE REPO IS THE RISK, and mutate.py refuses to do it for good reason: a
killed run leaves a mutation in the tree, invisible in `git status` if the file
was already dirty. So every write here is paired with a restore in a `finally`,
and the bytes are compared afterwards — a mismatch is reported as a failure of
this script rather than as a finding about the row. Run it on a clean tree.

# A HARNESS THAT DIES OBJECTS TO NOTHING, and "exited nonzero" cannot tell the two
# apart. The check below is that the named harness FAILS under the mutation — which
# a mutation that merely stops the realm building also satisfies, without the
# property ever being evaluated. Same shape as a mutation that fails to compile
# being scored as caught: invalid, not a result.
#
# WHAT THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE HAD TO BE MEASURED, because the obvious guess was
# wrong. A first version of this scanned for compiler text — "build error",
# "undefined:", "syntax error" — and an ablation planted an unclosed paren in
# emission.gno to check it. The guard accepted the row anyway: gno never prints a
# compiler message here. The unbuildable realm kills the in-memory NODE during
# genesis, and the output is a tm2 goroutine dump ending in `FAIL\tpkg` with no
# mention of the realm at all. The txtar script never runs.
#
# So the discriminator is not the failure's text but whether the harness named a
# LOCATION. A real objection points at a line — `FAIL: testdata/x.txtar:82` from a
# txtar, `stakeindex.gno:StakedPage calls getPos` from a python guard. A death
# points at nothing. That rule covers the node panic and whatever the next mode
# turns out to be, which a list of compiler spellings would not.
