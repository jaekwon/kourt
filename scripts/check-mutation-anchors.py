"""Check that every mutation row still anchors to exactly one place in its target.

A mutation row is a (pkg, file, find, replace) tuple: `mutate.py` locates `find`
in the file, swaps in `replace`, and requires the suite to go red. If `find` no
longer occurs, nothing was mutated and nothing was measured.

`mutate.py` ALREADY reports that as BAD ANCHOR and counts it as not-caught, so
this guard is not closing a hole in the batch. What it changes is WHEN you find
out. The batch stages a gno checkout, runs whole suites per row, takes minutes,
holds a lock, and cannot run beside anything else — so it is the gate run last
and least. This is a pure text scan of the corpus against the working tree:
sub-second, no checkout, no lock, safe to put in `make check`. Rot gets caught by
the commit that causes it instead of by whoever next runs the batch.

The rule itself and the pkg→directory map are IMPORTED from `mutate.py`
(`anchor_count`, `PKGS`), never restated. The first version of this file
hand-rolled both and read PKGS back out with a regex, which is the drift it
exists to prevent — and the regex failed loudly in a traceback rather than in
this guard's own words.

WHY IT IS WORTH A FILE. A merge brought 563 unique rows across from another
branch; 45 of them anchored nowhere and were dropped. They were not 45 problems.
They were three:

  - 19 quoted a panic string, and the rename moved the prefix `courtv2:` to
    `kourtv2:`. 15 of them needed nothing but the respelling; the other 4 had
    moved as well. A path guard cannot see this class — `courtv2:` inside a panic
    message is not a path. A HALF-RENAME HIDES IN DATA AS WELL AS IN PATHS.
  - 8 were anchored in the `defaultParams()` struct literal, and ONE added field
    (`stakeOpenDelayBlocks`, the longest name in the block) made gofmt re-align
    every line in it. SEVEN of those eight died to one space, with nothing about
    their values or their guards changed. The eighth looked like the same defect
    and was not: `minAnswerX` had also gone 100 CC → 1 CC in `a2b1123`, so it
    belongs in the third class below. A UNIFORM SYMPTOM IS NOT A UNIFORM CAUSE —
    the first pass here recorded all eight as one thing, twice: once as eight
    moved values, then as eight lost spaces. Both were wrong by one.
  - the rest tracked code that genuinely moved: sanitization pulled up into
    modrender helpers, and stake escrow replaced by a lock.

The first two classes are the reason for this guard. Both are invisible to
review, neither touches behaviour, and both are the ordinary consequence of a
rename or a field addition — which is to say they will happen again.

THREE CHECKS THE BATCH DOES NOT MAKE, because it sees one row at a time:

  - DUPLICATE TRIPLES. Two rows with the same (pkg, file, find, replace) are one
    mutation billed twice. The batch runs both, reports both caught, and reads as
    more coverage than exists. Eighteen such pairs were in this corpus, left by a
    merge that deduped on the LABEL. Three of the 45 dropped rows above turned out
    the same way: once respelled they landed on triples the corpus already had.
    A ROW THAT APPLIES CAN STILL BE A DUPLICATE.
  - ACROSS CORPUS FILES, not just within one. `mutate.py` documents a promotion
    path out of `mutations-*-KNOWN-GAPS.json` into the main batch; a promotion
    done by COPY instead of MOVE leaves the identical row in both files, and
    per-file checking would never see it.
  - DUPLICATE LABELS. The label is a row's only identity: `mutate.py` prints it
    with no index and its survivor list is labels alone, and `mutate-parallel.py`
    shards rows ROUND-ROBIN, so twins land in different shards and report in
    unrelated places. One label caught and the same label survived leaves a reader
    nothing to grep for. (A guard that genuinely exists in two realms would
    collide here; the fix then is a label prefix, which is an improvement.)

Also checked: the row is shaped like a row at all; `pkg` names a package
`mutate.py` can stage (`where()` raises SystemExit on an unknown one, which kills
the WHOLE batch at that row — loud, but every later row goes unmeasured, and
`mutate-parallel.py` turns the non-zero exit into "the run is NOT a result");
every `PKGS` key also has an `OBSERVERS` entry, because `OBSERVERS.get(pkg,
list(PKGS))` falls back to running EVERY package's suite, and then a suite red for
an unrelated reason reads as this row being caught — a `PKGS` entry added without
an `OBSERVERS` entry is exactly the silent version of the loud failure above;
the target file exists;
`replace` differs from `find` (a no-op row applies cleanly, leaves the source
unchanged, and is reported as a SURVIVOR — a phantom finding in a batch whose
whole contract is that there are none); and an `elsewhere` annotation — the one
sanctioned way to record that a row's coverage lives outside the mutated package
— names a file that is really there. An excuse pointing at a deleted file is
worse than no excuse.

That last one is deliberately STRICTER than `mutate.py`, which only prints the
value and would accept prose like "the txtar suite". Prose cannot rot detectably;
a path can. Every `elsewhere` in the corpus is a path, so the tightening costs
nothing today and stops the annotation from decaying into a shrug. (No count here:
this said "the corpus's one" and there are three.)

# AN `elsewhere` IS A PROMISE ABOUT A ROUTINE, so check the routine. The annotation says
# "this row survives here BY DESIGN, that harness covers it" — worth exactly as much as the
# chance anybody runs that harness. Measured when this was written: six of the seven
# elsewhere rows named txtar scripts, and `make check` did not reach txtar-test at all, so
# six promises rested on a suite only ever run by hand.
#
# THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS CHECK WAS VACUOUS, and the way it failed is the whole reason the
# rule is shaped as it is. It asked whether the path — or any ancestor directory of it —
# appeared in a recipe reachable from `check`, so harness/gnoland/testdata matched scenarios-check,
# a target that REGENERATES the scenario txtars and cmps them for staleness and never runs
# one. Both arms of the ablation reported "covered": with txtar-test in check and with it
# removed. A check that cannot go red is not a check, and being mentioned in a recipe is not
# being executed by it.
#
# So the question is EXECUTION, and it is answered per kind of harness, because "what runs
# this" has a different answer for a txtar script than for a python guard. An extension this
# does not know is a FAILURE and not a pass: an unrecognised harness is precisely the case
# where nobody has thought about whether it runs.
# A LABEL MUST NAME THE DEFECT, NOT A LINE. The label is the line a run prints when
# a row survives, so its whole job is to say what broke — and a line number stops
# being true the moment anything above it moves. This repo refuses line-number
# citations everywhere else for the same reason: check-citations rejects them in .gno
# and .md alike, with "Cite the file and an anchor instead. Line numbers rot."
#
# Twelve rows carried one — `modvote/mustCandidate:242: kourtv2: no such candidate` —
# after an earlier cleanup was believed to have removed them all, and two of those
# twelve differed from each other ONLY by the number, so the line was doing the work
# a name should have done: one guards a nil candidate tree, the other a missing key.
#
# The shape is `symbol:digits`, not a bare `:digits`, and that is deliberate. Real
# labels carry colons and digits all over — "v0.52: CounterFlag does not latch",
# "M3-HIGH-1: a terminal path returns the WHOLE bond", "P-CONST checkpoint MaxKey 128
# -> 1280" — and a looser pattern would fire on those. Measured: this one matches
# ZERO of the 1,240 labels in the corpus today and both of the twelve as they were.
