"""One block is five seconds, and this repo says so in four places.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is a repair rather than a worry — the drift it guards
against already happened once, in the direction this catches.

Three deadlines in kourtv2 are written down TWICE, once in blocks and once in
seconds, because the realm gates on whichever the record carries: a claim
decided before the stamps existed keeps the height it was decided under, and
everything since is judged on the clock. openrewards.gno spells the pattern out
where finalizeGrace is read — "Seconds first, blocks only for a claim whose
verdict predates the stamp, so a record keeps the deadline it was decided
under."

That is a good design and it has a cost: the two halves are one duration, and
NOTHING made them stay one duration. Change finalizeGraceSecs alone and old
records get a week while new ones get whatever you typed — silently, correctly
per the code, and wrong.

THE SAME SPLIT COST THREE SCENARIOS. p/governor moved its vote deadline from a
height to a stamp (closesTime, read by votingClosed); scn_covid, scn_dispute and
scn_rewards_demo went on advancing only the height, and a week-long vote stayed
open at ANY height for as long as the suite was red. That was a test bug, but it
was the same bug: two representations of one instant, kept in step by hand.

WHAT IT CHECKS, both halves of the conversion:

  1. The block time itself is ONE number. It is declared in the overlay
     (BLOCK_SECS), in p/governor (secsPerBlock, which converts VotingBlocks into
     the closesTime stamp) and in the scenario generator (BLOCK_SECS, which is
     how a scenario turns an advance_height into a span). Three copies, no
     import between them — they are three languages — so the only thing that can
     hold them together is a check.

  2. Every `<name>Blocks` / `<name>Secs` pair in the realm satisfies
     secs == blocks * that block time. Discovered by NAME, not from a list, so a
     third pair added tomorrow is covered the day it is written and nobody has
     to remember this file exists.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK. That five seconds is the right number for gno.land, or
that any given deadline is the right length. It checks that the repo AGREES with
itself, which is the failure that arrives without anyone deciding to make it.
