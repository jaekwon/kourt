"""Change the realm on purpose and see whether the tests object.

A test suite that passes tells you nothing on its own — it passes against
correct code and against code whose guard you deleted. This breaks the code in
a specific, named way and reports which mutations no test noticed. Those are
either a missing test or a claim the code does not actually make, and both are
worth knowing.

The second kind is the common one, and the shape is always the same: a rule the
source states in a comment and nothing checks. Who may call Cancel. Whether a
proposer may withdraw a proposal that has already succeeded. Whether
PastTotalVotes refuses an unsealed epoch the way PastVotes does. Whether
NewRules puts each number where it belongs.

Two ways this can lie to you:

  A mutation whose anchor matches zero times never applied, and a suite that
  passes without it looks exactly like a mutation that survived. Anchors must
  match EXACTLY once or the row is reported as BAD ANCHOR.

  A mutant that fails to BUILD is not a test objecting. That happens when a
  mutation removes the last use of an import, and it happened for a whole batch
  when the realm gained a dependency this script did not stage. Reported as
  INVALID rather than counted as a catch.

  And a suite that is already red reports every mutation as caught. The
  baseline runs first; if it fails, nothing else runs.

  A mutant that HANGS is none of the above, and it is the one that had no bound
  at all. Flip a comparison in a merge loop and the loop stops advancing rather
  than producing a wrong answer, so the suite never finishes to object — one such
  row spun for 56 minutes and would have spun for ever, indistinguishable from a
  slow machine. Every suite is bounded by SUITE_TIMEOUT now and a row that
  reaches it is TIMED OUT: counted with the non-results, never as a catch.

Usage — a JSON list of mutations on stdin, each applied and reverted in turn:

    python3 scripts/mutate.py <<'EOF'
    [
     {"file": "governor.gno",
      "label": "anyone may cancel anyone's proposal",
      "find": "\tif cur.Previous().Address() != p.proposer {",
      "replace": "\tif false {"}
    ]
    EOF

A saved batch for the kourtv2 money path lives at scripts/mutations-kourtv2.json:

Everything in that batch is CAUGHT, and it is meant to stay that way: a batch with
a standing survivor is a batch whose output people learn to skim. Guards that are
known to be unpinned live in scripts/mutations-kourtv2-KNOWN-GAPS.json instead —
every entry there survives, deliberately, and the file shrinks as tests are
written. Run it the same way; a CAUGHT result means one can move to the main batch.


    python3 scripts/mutate.py < scripts/mutations-kourtv2.json

Needs a gno toolchain. PKGS below lists every tree this can stage or mutate.

THE REPO'S SOURCES ARE NEVER WRITTEN TO. A mutation is applied to the STAGED COPY,
inside this run's own GNOROOT, between staging and testing.

It did not always work that way, and the reasons it changed are worth keeping. When
mutations went into the repo, a run that was KILLED left one there — invisible in an
untracked tree, where `git status` reports only that the directory is new. That cost
an hour once, to a mutant that recursed forever and made every later run "hang" for
no visible reason, and it needed a whole apparatus to paper over: backup files
written beside the sources, recovered on the next run, plus a standing rule to check
`git diff` before trusting any green suite.

Worse, it made two runs in ONE worktree corrupt each other silently. The second run
would find the first's backups, "recover" them — reverting a mutation that was at
that moment under test — and the row would report SURVIVED because nothing had been
broken. That is the harness's own failure mode, a non-result reported as a result,
which this file's header warns about in three other forms. Mutating the staged copy
removes the whole class: no backups, no recovery, no rule to remember, and any number
of runs in parallel.

        0 build errors, 1 test errors
        governor.gno:1532:2: goroutines are not permitted (code=gnoUnknownError)

    and a mutation whose only failure is a REALM PANIC AT INIT, which is a genuine
    catch, reports gnoUnknownError too. The same code for "never ran" and for "ran
    and something objected", so no amount of naming codes can separate them. That
    is what this function is for.

    `gno lint` answers it directly, and both sides were checked before this was

    the Bps mutation whose kourtv2 init invariant panics — a real catch — LINTS
    CLEAN and only fails under `gno test`. So lint means "it built", nothing more.

    Costs about 3.3s on kourtv2 against 12.9s for its suite, and it is only asked
