"""Every function that changes a moderator set's membership must discard its
pending m-of-n approvals.

Approvals record ADDRESSES and are never re-validated at fire time, so any entry
left standing across a membership change lets a moderator who is no longer a
member still count toward the threshold — including toward an irreversible purge.
That was a real vulnerability (v0.25): the outgoing set banked m-1 approvals on a
hide, the electorate replaced them with a disjoint set, and one member of the
incoming set fired it on the deposed signatures.

Three functions currently write `cm.members` or `cm.n`, and all three clear:
AppointMods, ResetModSet, and installModSet. This script exists to keep that
exhaustive.

WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A TEST. Two of the three are pinned by tests
(TestAppointModsDiscardsTheOutgoingSetsApprovals and
TestInstallModSetDiscardsTheDeposedSetsApprovals, the latter needing a court whose
voting window is short enough to finish inside pendingTTLBlocks, or it proves
nothing). ResetModSet's clear CANNOT be pinned by any test, and that is a fact
about the design rather than a gap: it empties the set, so nobody can act until
AppointMods or installModSet re-installs one, and both of those clear on the way
in. Its effect is always superseded. A mutation deleting it therefore survives
every possible test, and always will.

So the clear in ResetModSet is defence in depth, and the only thing that could
make it load-bearing is somebody adding a FOURTH way to install members. That is
exactly the kind of drift a test cannot see and a structural check can. If this
script ever fires, either add the clear or — if the new path genuinely cannot
leave a stale approval — say why, here, in this file.
