"""Check that the govern realm's citations still say what it claims they say.

r/govern argues for its design by pointing at the gno tree: storage
deposit is charged per object, MsgCall.Args is []string, a bptree must not be
modified during iteration. Those citations are the evidence. Without them the
design reads as taste, and a reader who checks one and finds it wrong has no
reason to trust the rest.

They were written as file:line, and they rotted within days of being written.
MsgCall.Args moved from line 102 to 108 because six lines were added above it,
and exposed_tellers.gno was renamed to tellers.gno while CallerTeller stayed
put on line 11. Neither claim became false. Both addresses did.

So the citations are file + ANCHOR now, and the anchor is a regex matched
anywhere in the file. An anchor survives every edit above it, which is what
actually happens to a file, and fails only when the thing itself moves or is
renamed — which is real news and worth a build break. The reader greps for the
same string the checker does.

Three questions:

  1. Does every cited anchor still match in the cited file?
  2. Is every manifest entry actually cited in the prose? (A stale entry that
     checks nothing passes forever.)
  3. Has anyone written a new file:line citation? Those rot silently, which is
     the whole reason this file exists.

Needs a gno checkout. Skips cleanly without one unless REQUIRE_GNO is set, on
the same reasoning as the Makefile's realm-test: a silent skip must never be
mistaken for a real run.

# A citation that migrated with the code it explains is still a citation, and
# the point of the second check below is that every row is quoted SOMEWHERE.
# DESIGN.md lives in docs/ rather than beside the realm it describes, because
# ReadMemPackage publishes whatever is in the directory — a design record left
# there is deployed on chain, and this one is a quarter of the govern realm's
# deploy. It still quotes the gno tree, so it still has to be checked.

# The court realms and their packages are listed on this file's OWN stated
# principle — "listed so that the first one somebody adds is watched rather
# than discovered". They were not listed before, and the omission is the same
# shape as the one check 4 below names: a guard whose coverage is opt-in. It is
# how check-isolation came to sweep 151 of 388 tests without anybody noticing.
# They make no line-number citations today; that is the point of adding them
# now rather than after the first one rots.
