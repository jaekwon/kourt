"""Check that every crossing entrypoint refuses a stale realm frame.

Every `func F(cur realm, ...)` in this repo opens by refusing a frame that has
already returned:

    if !cur.IsCurrent() {
        panic(errStaleRealm)
    }

WHY A GUARD THAT READS RATHER THAN A TEST THAT RUNS. There is no test for this and
there cannot be one. r/govern/token_test.gno worked it out first, for its own
fourteen entrypoints: the harness has no way to hand an entrypoint a realm value
from a frame that has returned, because `cross()` is IsCurrent-strict and a
function literal cannot take a realm argument under any name but `cur`. Its
conclusion — "an assertion that cannot fail is worse than none, so there is not
one" — is right, and so is the sentence after it: what actually holds the
invariant is that the entrypoints are "one line each, checkable by reading".

This is that reading, done by a machine instead of by whoever remembers. It was
written after a mutation row deleting the check from kourtv2's mustDeployer
SURVIVED the entire corpus, which is the correct verdict from a harness that
cannot reach the line and no comfort at all about the ~60 other sites.

TWO FORMS ARE ACCEPTED, and the second is verified rather than trusted:

  * the check itself, as the first statement.
  * a call to a `mustX(cur)` helper whose OWN first statement is the check. A
    delegation is only as good as its delegate, so the delegate is looked up in
    the same package and checked; a call to a helper that skips the check is a
    failure naming both. Today there is exactly one such helper
    (kourtv2/mustDeployer) carrying four call sites.

Exemptions are named individually with a reason, and a stale one — naming a
function that no longer exists — is a failure. An exemption list that silently
rots is how a guard comes to watch nothing.
