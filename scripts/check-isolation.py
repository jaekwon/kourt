"""Run every realm test on its own, and require it to pass there too.

A gno test file shares package state with every other test in it. These suites
reset what they know to reset — the trees, the supply, the clock — and two
things were never on that list: the KIND REGISTRY, and where the clock had got
to. So a test could pass only in company:

  A rules test asserting messages that need the kind "fee" to exist, without
  registering it. Some neighbour always has. Run alone it refuses every payload
  with "no kind by that name has been offered" instead — and an assertion on
  the prefix every refusal shares matches that too, so the dependency stays
  invisible until the messages get specific.

  A history test asserting a holder had nothing at epoch 1. True only because
  neighbours pushed the clock well past epoch 1; run first, its own mint lands
  there and the holder has ten.

Both pass in the suite. Neither is testing what it says. That is the failure
mode this guards: not a test that breaks, but one that quietly reports on the
wrong thing.

    python3 scripts/check-isolation.py
    python3 scripts/check-isolation.py --only TestSomething   # one test

The whole sweep runs each suite once per test — every Test function in every
staged package, presently a few hundred of them and a quarter of an hour — so it
is its own target rather than part of realm-test. --only exists so a control can
prove this guard fires without paying for the sweep.

That cost is stated as a range on purpose. It read "143 of them, a few minutes"
for as long as the realm lists were a hand-copy, and stayed at 143 through the
fix that added kourtv2 and quadrupled the real number. A figure nobody can
recompute from the tree is a figure that will be wrong again.

Everything `make realm-test` compiles, not just the realm most likely to have
the problem. Covering where somebody has already looked is opt-in coverage, and
opt-in coverage is how a citation goes unregistered, a filetest unbudgeted and a
guard uncontrolled. The point of a sweep is the instance nobody predicted.

Needs a gno toolchain; skips without one unless REQUIRE_GNO is set, and says so
rather than passing quietly.

# drifted and nothing noticed: it swept 151 tests while realm-test compiled 388,

# p/twap, p/cshares, p/tickbook, p/curve) — i.e. the system under active
# development. A guard that measures less than it claims is worse than no guard,
