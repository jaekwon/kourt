"""Check that no file still points at a realm path the rename retired.

The project was cryptocourt and is Kourt. `r/court` became
`r/kourtv1`, `r/courtv2` became `r/kourtv2`, and the import org
`gno.land/{p,r}/cryptocourt/...` became `gno.land/{p,r}/kourt/...`. A reference to
any retired spelling points at nothing.

This guard exists because hand searching failed TWICE — once during the branch
merge and once in the cleanup after it — and both times the same way: a set of
grep patterns was assumed to be the whole class. Four spellings slipped through,
and WHY each one did is the useful part:

  - `r/court` written WITHOUT a trailing slash, so a search for
    `r/court/` missed it. It sat in a .gno comment.
  - `{p,r}/cryptocourt` inside a docstring, so a search for `r/cryptocourt`
    missed it — and that docstring told the reader the staging path "cannot be
    changed" while the Makefile had already changed it.
  - `p/cryptocourt`, for the mirror reason.
  - `r/kourt/court` — a HALF-rename, org updated and realm not. This is the one
    worth the whole file: a path that has never existed at any point, so a search
    for the OLD name misses it and a search for the NEW name misses it too. It
    sat in three files and was found only by a reviewer reading prose.

AN ENUMERATION THAT CLAIMS TO BE COMPLETE IS A CLAIM, NOT A FACT, and a set of
search patterns is exactly such an enumeration. Review proved that again on this
very file: the first version's half-rename pattern ended in `(?![a-z0-9])`, which
matched `kourt/court` and therefore NOT `kourt/courtv2` — the V2 half-rename
escaped the pattern written for half-renames. So the patterns are now pinned by
FIXTURES that run before any scan (see SELFTEST below). A regex that stops
matching what it was written for now fails the build instead of reporting clean.

SCOPE: PATHS, not the project's name in prose. `Cryptocourt's own ledger` is a
stale NAME and a different, lesser problem — it misleads nobody about where code
lives. Every pattern below is anchored to a path separator for that reason, which
is also why this guard needs almost no allowlist: a bare word would have needed
one row per changelog entry that mentions the old name.

Three questions:

  1. Do the patterns still match what they were written to match? (SELFTEST)
  2. Does any tracked file contain a retired path outside the allowlist?
  3. Is the allowlist itself still accurate? Every exemption pins a COUNT, not a
     filename, because a file can legitimately mention an old path while ALSO
     acquiring a new stale one — gnoroot.py did exactly that, carrying two
     deliberate spellings and one rotted docstring together. A blanket per-file
     exemption would have hidden it. Drift is reported in both directions: too
     many means new rot, too few means the exemption has outlived its reason.

Pure text scan. No gno checkout, no staging, no lock.
