"""Every guard in scripts/ is reachable from `make check`, or exempt with a reason.

    python3 scripts/check-guards-run.py

WHY THIS EXISTS. A guard that nothing runs is worse than no guard: it reads like
coverage in the tree and in review, and it reports nothing. There was no check
that the check scripts themselves are wired in — check-guards-armed proves each
one has a control arm, and check-mutation-anchors' routinely_run only validates a
mutation row's "covered elsewhere" excuse. Neither notices a guard dropped out of
the Makefile, and the Makefile is edited by hand: seven web checks had drifted
onto a target named `height-shim`, and moving them is exactly the operation that
loses one.

FAILS CLOSED BOTH WAYS, because the two failures need opposite fixes:

  * a guard reachable from no target is a guard that stopped running — wire it up,
    or exempt it here and say why;
  * an exemption naming a guard that is gone, or one that is now reachable, is an
    excuse nobody rechecked — delete it. An exemption list that only ever grows
    becomes the place unrun guards go to be forgotten, which is the failure this
    file is about.

REACHABILITY, NOT MENTION. The walk starts at `check` and follows prerequisites,
so a guard sitting in a target no one depends on does not count. That is the
distinction that matters: `isolation-test` is a real target with a real recipe,
and `make check` has never called it.
