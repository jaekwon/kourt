"""An advisory lock for the one runner that mutates the WORKING TREE.

Every other runner stages into its own GNOROOT shadow (scripts/gnoroot.py), so
they are safe to run concurrently and routinely are. selftest-checks.py is the
exception and cannot be made to follow: its whole job is to break a guard and
watch it complain, and the guards read the repository's own sources. So it edits
those sources in place, one at a time, restoring each afterwards.

That is fine alone and invisible in parallel. Running `make check` beside a
selftest produced this, and it looks exactly like a real defect:

    2 citation(s) need attention.
    UNUSED gnovm/pkg/gnolang/store.go  'NoProseSaysThis'
    UNCITED nobody_cited_this.gno is named in r/govern/errors.gno

Both are selftest's own controls, caught mid-mutation by a reader that had no way
to know. A FALSE FAILURE IN A DIFFERENT GATE IS THE WORST KIND: it names a file
you did not touch, for a reason that is not true, and the natural response is to
go fix the citation that was never wrong.

So the mutating runner announces itself, and the readers refuse rather than
report. A refusal that says "someone is rewriting the tree" costs one re-run; a
phantom citation error costs a diagnosis.

RE-ENTRANCY. selftest INVOKES the readers as its controls, so it must not lock
itself out. It exports its pid, children inherit that through the environment,
and a reader whose inherited pid matches the holder proceeds normally.

# A CLI, because the two callers that most need this lock cannot import it.
#
#   * `make realm-test` is a shell recipe. Every PYTHON guard in it already calls
#     refuse_if_held, and the recipe around them did not — so a reader that was
#     careful about check-citations went on to copy r/*/*.gno into a
#     GNOROOT with no such scruple. That is not hypothetical: two consecutive
#     `make check` runs failed on tests nobody had touched, one in association_test
#     and one in associationcaps_test, because the copy caught a break that another
#     session had armed by hand and restored moments later. Neither reproduced.
#     A false failure in a different gate is the worst kind, and this file's own
#     docstring says so.
#
#   * arming a guard BY HAND — break it, run the suite, put it back — is the
#     exact thing this lock is for, and it was only reachable by importing the
#     module, which a person at a terminal will not do. `hold --` wraps any
#     command, so the announcement costs one prefix:
#
#         python3 scripts/repolock.py hold -- sh -c 'edit; gno test .; restore'
