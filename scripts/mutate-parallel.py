"""Run a mutation batch as N concurrent shards, and report ONE verdict.

The batch is now large enough that its wall clock matters: 241 rows took 14m42s,
and it grows with every guard pinned. Where that time goes was measured rather
than guessed — staging a shard costs 0.03s and one courtv2 suite run costs 3.67s,
so staging is 1% and caching it would buy nothing. The cost is irreducibly ONE
SUITE RUN PER MUTATION, which is what mutation testing is.

So the lever is parallelism, and it is available because each runner now builds
its own GNOROOT (scripts/gnoroot.py) and mutations are applied to the staged copy
rather than the repo (scripts/mutate.py). Nothing is shared between shards: not
the staged tree, not the sources, not a lock. That was not true two versions ago,
when two concurrent mutate runs corrupted each other through the backup files.

Rows are split ROUND-ROBIN, not in contiguous blocks, so a shard does not end up
holding every row for one slow package.

The single all-caught number is the point of the batch — it is what makes a run
readable at a glance — so this prints every row as its shard reports it and then
ONE aggregate summary over all of them. A shard that dies, or a baseline that is
red in any shard, fails the whole run: a shard whose rows never ran must not be
able to look like a shard whose rows all passed.
