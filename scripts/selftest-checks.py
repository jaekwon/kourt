"""Break things on purpose and check that the checkers notice.

A guard reporting success while measuring nothing is indistinguishable, from
the outside, from a guard that works. Every one in scripts/ is capable of it,
in a specific way:

  check-citations exempting a citation that names a file in its own scope —
  the exact class it exists for, exempted by name. Or failing to see a gno-tree
  file NAMED in the prose and never given a row, so a claim is exempt from the
  guard by never having been registered with it.

  check-storage reading the phrase "build errors", which matches the ordinary
  summary line "0 build errors, 1 test errors", so every catch from a filetest
  reads as a mutation that never compiled.

  mutate.py counting a mutation whose anchor matched zero times as a survivor,
  counting a mutant that could not build as a catch, or reporting every
  mutation as caught because the suite was already failing.

  A realm test passing only in company — needing a kind a neighbour registered,
  or asserting a literal epoch that only predates its holder because a
  neighbour moved the clock.

None of those are visible by reading the code. Each is found by breaking
something and noticing the guard stays quiet — and an ad-hoc control is
precisely the step that gets skipped when the guard is already green.

So the controls live here. Each one edits a copy, runs the guard, requires the
expected complaint, and puts the original back.

    python3 scripts/selftest-checks.py

Needs a gno toolchain for the storage arms; skips them without one, and says so
rather than passing quietly.

# THE ARM THAT AUDITS THE OTHER ARMS. A control whose `want` string is ALREADY in its

# wired to nothing. This file's own comments record the class happening once, two arms
# wanting bare "STALE" and "ALLOWLIST" that the baseline already printed while two real
# stale paths were outstanding; it happened again with an arm wanting bare "getPos", which
# check-read-purity prints in its SUCCESS line. Reading for it does not work: the arm looks
# right and the run says fires.
#
# So it is mechanical now. Parse this file's own control() calls, run each distinct guard
# on the CLEAN tree once, and object to any `want` the clean output already contains.
# Controls whose argv is not a plain list of literals or module constants cannot be
# resolved and are COUNTED OUT LOUD rather than skipped quietly — an audit that silently
# ignores what it cannot parse is the same vacuity one level up.
# THE RESOLVER IS SHARED, not re-written here. This function's first version took
# `want` and every argv element only as an ast.Constant, and counted the rest out
# loud: 7 of 117 unresolvable. Six of those seven were arms passing no `argv` at
# all — control() defaults them to check-citations, so they were resolvable all
# along — and the seventh builds its want by concatenation. check-control-anchors
# already evaluates the five shapes these call sites use (literal, module
# constant, f-string, os.path.join, concatenation) and is measured at 117 of 117,
