// A realm that is not govern publishes a power, on a chain.
//
// This is the claim the governor's whole shape rests on, and it has only ever
// been checked from inside package govern — where a test writes to the kind
// registry directly, proving the machinery rather than the claim — or in a
// filetest, which is one process and no chain.
//
// It also closes the only thing this realm emits that nothing asserted.
// KindOffered carries the name, the offerer and all six terms; gno's test
// stdlib cannot read events, and Offer takes a Kind INTERFACE, which MsgCall
// cannot carry. So the only way to see it is a second realm, deployed, calling
// Offer for us.

	// The tempting shortcut is to deploy govern at its REAL path, because the

	// per node and is "already deployed" forever after, which silently pins the
	// test to whatever govern that node saw first: add an exported function to
	// govern, call it from the offerer, and this fails with `undefined:
	// govern.TextOnly` while every local test passes, because realm-test stages
	// both from source and agrees with itself.

	// is what AddPackage actually compiles — so the import is rewritten in
