// that are only true of a chain: whether the package it imports resolves when
// it is fetched rather than found on disk, whether init() sees a deployer,
// whether the whole thing fits inside a transaction's gas. Until this test the
// govern realm had never been deployed anywhere.
//
// It also pins the deploy ORDER, which is the part that cannot be undone.
// p/kourt/checkpoint/v0 has to exist on chain before r/kourt/govern will
// compile, and a realm cannot be redeployed at its path — so getting the order
// wrong costs the path rather than the transaction.
